## The predictability of fake news

## Abstract
A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
Motivation: to decide whether a statement is fake news or not. 

## Research questions

What features are associated with fake news?
- What are the sentiments and most common words used in fake news? 
- How accurate can we predict fake news by creating a detector using these features? 
- What approach leads to the highest accuracy in prediction? 

## Dataset: The Liar Dataset
- [Liar Dataset](https://github.com/thiagorainmaker77/liar_dataset)
- The Liar Dataset is a manually labeled dataset of short statements from politifact.com. The statements are manually labeled into ‘pants on fire’, ’false’, ‘barely true’, ‘half true’, ‘mostly true’. The dataset also contains information on the subject of the statement, who produced it, his job, party and the context. 
- The dataset is divided into a training (+- 1200 lines) and a test-set (way larger)
- First of all we would like to analyse the statements in terms of sentiment analysis. 
- After, we would like to use the labeled data to determine, using machine learning, which features are the most important in the prediction of fake news.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project

Determine which method of lexicon based sentiment analysis model can we best apply to fake news. 
Determine for all words of the statements in the train dataset what the prominence of the word in fake news is. 
Building an effective fake news detector on the training set. 
Analyzing how accurate the fake news detector is. 

Add here a sketch of your planning for the coming weeks. Please mention who does what.

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
